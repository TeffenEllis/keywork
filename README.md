Keywork may be right for you if...

- You're building your web app almost entirely within the Cloudflare Workers platform
- You find yourself writing a lot of "glue-code" to wrangle your growing set of Workers
- Your site is hosted on a single Worker and you'd like to split its logic into smaller and more manageable bundles
- Your routing logic is outgrowing Cloudflare Pages
- You'd like to use Workers KV as a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase

**See <https://keywork.app> for more detailed documentation.**

### Routing

Keywork has everything you need to handle incoming requests in a Cloudflare Worker environment.
Application routing remains _magic-free_, and uses an Express.js inspired API that doesn't stray far from
the native design patterns of the Worker platform.

And thanks to modular and type-safe API, Keywork provides opinionated and structured
guidence as your web app grows, without locking you into a specific pattern.

### React just works

At long last, Keywork takes React beyond the basics of static site generation, and into full dynamic pages.

Keywork makes server-side rendering as simple as _an API with a UI_:

- Define your routes
- Fetch your static props
- Render a React component

Keywork handles client-side hydration, and fits into your existing architecture without ceremony.
And with rendering made even faster with built-in support for streamed responses,
your app is delivered and interactive in seconds.

### Code bundling without the guesswork

Using Keywork means spending less of your precious time configuring ESBuild,
and allows you to focus on the task at hand ‚Äî building great web apps.
And with [readymade templates](https://github.com/nirrius/keywork-example-react-esbuild) available,
you can skip the boilerplate and start coding in seconds.
