Everything you need to handle incoming requests in a Worker environment.

- Static prop handlers that feel just like your typical API endpoints.
- Server-side rendering from your worker, made even faster with streamed responses.
- Routing helpers with a low-mental overhead that make splitting your app into separate workers a breeze.
- Client-side hydration that fits into your existing build pipeline.

### Collections (Beta)

The missing piece that unlocks the full power of storing and querying data from your Worker.

- A NoSQL _eventually-consistent_ ODM for Cloudflare's [Worker KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/).
- An API reminiscent of Firebase and MongoDB, perfect for migrating your existing backend to Cloudflare's network.
- Extends Worker KV's API without abstracting away important details.

### Common core utilities for building web apps.

- HTTP responses for content like JSON, HTML, and much more!
- Type-safe request handlers that make API endpoints easy.
- Cache headers, cache responses, and even ETag generation for your own content.
- Simplified error handling for your server-side Worker logic.
- URL helpers, path builders.
- ULID and Snowflake ID generation.
- Isomorpic runtime error handling for both the browser, and your Worker.
- Logging that helps you better trace down errors as your app grows.
