# What is Keywork?

**Keywork** is a batteries-included library for building serverless web apps on Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Node.JS

```tsx
import { KeyworkRouter } from 'keywork/router'

const app = new KeyworkRouter()

app.get('/', () => <h1>Hello from Keywork! ðŸ‘‹</h1>)

export default app
```

## Why use Keywork?

**V8 Isolates** are an emerging technology offered by cloud-computing services,
that allow web apps to deploy quickly, and be served from around the world.
Compared to more traditional cloud services, V8 Isolates offer faster response times,
and even scale at more affordable prices than virtual machines and containers.

**_However_**, building a web app with V8 Isolates can come with several drawbacks,
and may lock your code into a single platform.

**Keywork makes V8 Isolates easier to use.**

## Serverless web apps without vendor lock-in

Whether you're creating a new web app, or refactoring an existing code-base,
choosing a serverless provider is challenging...

You may not have enough information to make a choice between providers such as [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). You may want to try several providers and compare their pricing models, or even [self-host](https://lagon.app) your own V8 Isolates platform.

**Keywork allows you to build V8 compatible web apps without vendor lock-in,
and supports Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, and Node.JS**

## Routing

Keywork has everything you need to handle incoming requests in a Cloudflare Worker environment.
Application routing remains _magic-free_, and uses an Express.js inspired API that doesn't stray far from
the native design patterns of the Worker platform.

```ts title="GET https://example.com/greet/jessie"
interface GreetParams {
  firstName: string
}

app.get<GreetParams>('/greet/:firstName', ({ params }) => {
  return `Hello there! ${params.firstName}`
})
```

Keywork is the next step when your routing logic outgrows [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#functions-routing).
And thanks to modular and type-safe API, Keywork provides an opinionated and structured
guidence as your web app grows, without locking you into a specific design-pattern.

### React just works

At long last, Keywork takes React beyond the basics of static site generation, and into full dynamic pages.

Keywork makes server-side rendering as simple as _an API with a UI_:

- Define your routes
- Fetch your static props
- Render a React component

Keywork handles client-side hydration, and fits into your existing architecture without ceremony.
And with rendering made even faster with built-in support for streamed responses,
your app is delivered and interactive in seconds.

### Isomorphic error handling, made easier.

Whether you're handling errors in your V8 Worker, Node.JS, or even the browser,
Keywork includes error utilities that pair nicely with HTTP requests.

```ts
import { KeyworkRouter } from 'keywork/router'
import { KeyworkResourceError, Status } from 'keywork/errors'

interface LoginPayload {
  email: string
  password: string
}

app.post('/login', async ({ request }) => {
  const payload: LoginPayload = await request.body.json()

  if (!payload.email) {
    return new KeyworkResourceError('Email is required', Status.BadRequest)
  }
})
```

## Code bundling without the guesswork

Using Keywork means spending less of your precious time configuring ESBuild,
and allows you to focus on the task at hand â€” building great web apps.
And with [readymade templates](https://github.com/nirrius/keywork-starter-kit) available,
you can skip the boilerplate and start coding in seconds.

### Tools to manage your growing codebase

Cloudflare Workers are limited to [just 1 megabyte](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#worker-size) after compression, and even a modestly-sized codebase may push against this limit.

**Keywork allows your web app to be split into smaller and more manageable Worker deployments**

You'd like to use Workers KV as a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase

## Core utilities for building web apps

If you find yourself writing a lot of "glue-code",
Keywork also includes the typical "kitchen drawer" stuff you usually have to implement when building a web app,
including...

- Logging that helps you better trace down errors as your app grows.
- Cache headers, cache responses, and even ETag generation for your own content.
- Session management to aid in authenticating users.
- Static asset utilities with support for Cloudflare Pages and Worker Sites.

[**All that and much, much more!**](../modules/)
