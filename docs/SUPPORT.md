## Debugging

Remember, the V8 Isolates runtime uses a JavaScript that is more like a web browser than Node.
Node-exclusive patterns, such as `process.env` and `require('path')` are not compatible unless replaced during build time with a polyfill.

- Built-in Node modules may have browser standard analogues and can be used instead.
- Modules such as `fs` donâ€™t apply to the duties of a Worker and should not be used.
- Modules that use native C extensions such as `libsass` will generally be incompatible with V8 Isolates.
