Keywork is a modular and opinionated library, providing structured guidence as your web app grows, without locking you into a specific pattern.

## Popular Modules

### Router

Designed with familiarity in mind, the server-side routing API is inspired by
Express.js, React Router, and the native Cloudflare Workers platform.

While optional, Keywork uses React as its primary HTML templating engine.

### Bundling

Using Keywork means that you'll spend less of your precious time configuring ESBuild,
and more on the real task at hand — building great web apps.
