/**
 * Keywork includes a collection of components that are useful for building a full web app
 * within just a single V8 Worker, or among a collection of Workers.
 *
 * Generally, you won't need to use these components directly and Keywork will handle
 * the rendering of the HTML document for you. However, if you need more control over
 * the rendering process, you can use these components to build your hydration logic.
 *
 * ## `KeyworkHTMLDocument`
 *
 * The `KeyworkHTMLDocument` component is the most commonly used.
 * It is used to wrap the entire application, and is responsible for rendering the
 * HTML document that is sent to the client. It is here where you can inject your
 * own `<head>` content, such as `<meta>` tags, `<link>` tags, and `<script>` tags.
 *
 * ## `KeyworkProviders`
 *
 * The `KeyworkProviders` component offers a advanced approach to wrapping your entire application
 * with a React context, such as a `react-router` provider, or `react-redux` provider.
 * This isn't a component *per se*, but rather a slot that you can use to inject your own
 * provider component.
