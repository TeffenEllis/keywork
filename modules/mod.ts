/**
 * Keywork is a modular and opinionated library,
 * providing structured guidence as your web app grows,
 * without locking you into a specific pattern.
 *
 * Features are categorized into modules that can be imported directly:
 *
 * ```ts title="worker.ts" runtime="cloudflare"
 * // highlight-next-line
 * import { RequestRouter } from 'keywork/router'
 *
 * const app = new RequestRouter()
 *
 * app.get('/', () => 'Hello there! ðŸ‘‹')
 *
 * export default app
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts title="./your-project/server/mod.tsx" runtime="deno"
 * // highlight-next-line
 * import { RequestRouter } from 'https://deno.land/x/keywork/modules/router/mod.ts'
 * import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts'
 *
 * const app = new RequestRouter()
 * serve((request) => app.fetch(request))
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts title="worker.ts" runtime="browser"
 * // highlight-next-line
 * import { RequestRouter } from 'https://esm.sh/keywork/router'
 *
 * const app = new RequestRouter()
 *
 * app.get('/', () => 'Hello there! ðŸ‘‹')
 * ```
 *
 * :::tip
 *
 * While Keywork has many modules,
 * modern bundlers and transpilers such as [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
 * will intelligently bundle only the Keywork modules you include in your web app.
 *
 * A full list of Keywork's modules are available in the navigation menu, however
 * the most popular are shown below.
