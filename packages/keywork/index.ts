 * Everything you need to handle incoming requests in a Worker environment.
 *

 * - Server-side rendering from your worker, made even faster with streamed responses.
 * - Routing helpers with a low-mental overhead that make splitting your app into separate workers a breeze.
 * - Client-side hydration that fits into your existing build pipeline.
