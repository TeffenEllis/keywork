**Keywork** is a batteries-included, _magic-free_, library for building web apps on Cloudflare Workers.

Keywork may be right for you if...

- You're building your web app almost entirely within the Cloudflare Workers platform
- You find yourself building a lot of "glue-code" to wrangle your growing set of Workers
- Your site is hosted on a single Worker and you'd like to split its logic into smaller and more manageable bundles
- Your application routing logic is too complex for Cloudflare Pages
- You'd like to use Workers KV as a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase

## Features

- ðŸ’ª Written in TypeScript
- ðŸ“š Modules Support
- ðŸ”¥ Compatible with [Miniflare](https://miniflare.dev/)

**See <https://keywork.app> for more detailed documentation.**

The missing piece that unlocks the full power of storing and querying data from your Worker.

- A NoSQL _eventually-consistent_ ODM for Cloudflare's [Worker KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/).
